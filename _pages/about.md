Hi! I'm Hangzhou He (<font face=STKaiti>ä½•èˆªèˆŸ</font>), a Ph.D. student at College of Future Technology, Peking University. I work at Molecular Imaging / Medical Intelligence Lab ([MILAB](https://wiki.milab.wiki/)) at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Qiushi Ren and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Yanye Lu.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision and medical image analysis, especially in explainable and robust AI. I am also passionate about leveraging these technologies for artistic creation ;-).
