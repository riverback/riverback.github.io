Hi! I'm Hangzhou He (何航舟). I'm now a undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, minor in Biomedical Engineering. My research interests include deep learning, computer vision and medical image analysis, especially in explainable and robust AI. I am also passionate about leveraging these technologies for artistic creation ;-).

Currently, I'm working on some projects related to attribution methods for understanding vision models, and I'm also interested in developing vision models that are robust to adversarial attacks and domain shifts.
