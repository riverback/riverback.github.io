Hi! I'm Hangzhou He (<font face=STKaiti>何航舟</font>), a Ph.D. student at College of Future Technology, Peking University. I study at Molecular Imaging / Medical Intelligence Lab ([MILAB](https://wiki.milab.wiki/)) at Peking University, under the supervision of assistant professor [Yanye Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&authuser=1&user=WSFToOMAAAAJ) and professor [Qiushi Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&authuser=1&user=7cOdUFgAAAAJ).

My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and biomedical applications, with a particular emphasis on the trustworthiness of deep learning models, including explainability, generalization, and robustness.
