title: "On the Duality Between Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Adversarial Training (Arxiv)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-23-SAM_ge_AT
excerpt: 'We find that using sharpness-aware minimization alone can improve adversarial robustness. To understand this unexpected property of SAM, we first provide empirical and theoretical insights and conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SAM can improve adversarial robustness notably without sacrificing any clean accuracy.'
